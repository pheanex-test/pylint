## [C0123](#C0123) (unidiomatic-typecheck)<a name="C0123"></a>
Using type() instead of isinstance() for a typecheck..

The idiomatic way to perform an explicit typecheck in Python is to use isinstance(x, Y) rather than type(x) == Y, type(x) is Y. Though there are unusual situations where these give different results.

## [C0200](#C0200) (consider-using-enumerate)<a name="C0200"></a>
Consider using enumerate instead of iterating with range and len.

Emitted when code that iterates with range and len is encountered. Such code can be simplified by using the enumerate builtin.

## [C0201](#C0201) (consider-iterating-dictionary)<a name="C0201"></a>
Consider iterating the dictionary directly instead of calling .keys().

Emitted when the keys of a dictionary are iterated through the .keys() method. It is enough to just iterate through the dictionary itself, as in "for key in dictionary".

## [C0202](#C0202) (bad-classmethod-argument)<a name="C0202"></a>
Class method %s should have %s as first argument.
